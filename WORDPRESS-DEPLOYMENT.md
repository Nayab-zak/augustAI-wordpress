# 🚀 WordPress Deployment Guide - CORRECTED

## ⚠️ **Important Clarification**

You're deploying a **static website** to WordPress hosting, NOT a WordPress site. There's no separate "WordPress wp-config.php" to edit.

## ✅ **Correct Deployment Process**

### **Step 1: Push All Files to Git**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy static site with credentials"
git push origin main
```

### **Step 2: WordPress Auto-Deployment**
- WordPress will pull from Git automatically
- All files (including credentials) will be deployed
- No additional configuration needed

### **Step 3: Files Structure on WordPress**
```
your-wordpress-site/
├── index.php (main site)
├── index.html (backup)
├── config-simple.php (credentials)
├── contact handlers (*.php)
├── assets/ (logos)
└── debug.php (troubleshooting)
```

## 🔐 **Security for Git + WordPress Deployment**

Since you need credentials on the server, here are your options:

### **Option 1: Private Repo + Direct Push (Current)**
✅ **What you're doing now**
- Keep repo private
- Push credentials to private Git
- WordPress deploys automatically
- Only you have access

### **Option 2: Environment Variables (Advanced)**
- Use WordPress hosting environment variables
- More complex setup
- Better for teams

## 🚨 **Fixing the 500 Error**

The error is likely due to:

1. **File paths** - Files not uploaded correctly
2. **PHP errors** - Syntax issues
3. **Missing files** - Logo files missing

### **Quick Fix Steps:**

1. **Test basic functionality:**
   ```
   https://august.com.pk/test-simple.php
   https://august.com.pk/debug.php
   ```

2. **Use static version temporarily:**
   - Access your WordPress file manager
   - Rename `index.html` to `index-backup.php` 
   - Rename `index.php` to `index-broken.php`
   - Rename `index-backup.php` to `index.php`
   - This makes your site work immediately

3. **Check file upload:**
   - Ensure `assets/` folder uploaded
   - Ensure all `.php` files uploaded
   - Check file permissions (644 for files, 755 for folders)

## 📁 **What to Commit to Git**

✅ **Safe to commit to PRIVATE repo:**
- All `.php` files (including config-simple.php with credentials)
- All `.html` files  
- Assets folder
- All contact handlers

❌ **Never commit to PUBLIC repo:**
- Files with real passwords
- Real phone numbers
- Real email credentials

## 🧪 **Testing**

After deployment:
1. Visit `https://august.com.pk/test-simple.php`
2. If that works, visit `https://august.com.pk/debug.php`
3. If debug shows errors, we can fix them specifically

## 🧪 Testing After Deployment

1. **Visit your site** - should work with constants
2. **Test contact form** - check if submissions work
3. **Check email delivery** - visit `/test-email.php`
4. **Monitor logs** - check `contact_log.txt`

### 🚨 Troubleshooting HTTP 500 Errors

If you get "HTTP ERROR 500":

1. **Test basic functionality**:
   ```
   http://yoursite.com/test-simple.php
   http://yoursite.com/debug.php
   ```

2. **Check file permissions**:
   ```bash
   chmod 644 *.php
   chmod 644 *.html
   chmod 755 assets/
   ```

3. **Common fixes**:
   - **Missing WordPress constants**: Add constants to wp-config.php
   - **File path issues**: Ensure all files uploaded correctly
   - **PHP version**: Requires PHP 7.4+ 
   - **Missing files**: Check if logo files uploaded to /assets/

4. **Fallback options**:
   - Use `index.html` instead of `index.php` (static version)
   - Check server error logs in cPanel/hosting panel
   - Contact hosting provider if PHP errors persist

## 🔄 Alternative Methods

### Method 1: WordPress Constants (Recommended)
- Add constants to wp-config.php manually
- Most secure for WordPress

### Method 2: WordPress Environment Variables
- Use WordPress environment variable plugins
- Good for team collaboration

### Method 3: Manual File Upload
- Upload `.env` separately via FTP/cPanel
- Not recommended for Git workflows

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Never commit real credentials to Git**
2. **Always add sensitive constants directly to live wp-config.php**
3. **Use app passwords for Gmail SMTP**
4. **Test email delivery after deployment**
5. **Keep constants above "stop editing" line in wp-config.php**

## 📞 Fallback Contact Methods

If email fails, these always work:
- WhatsApp: Defined in constants
- Phone: Direct tel: links
- Calendly: Direct booking link
