                <p>I'm a systems engineer who believes in shipping working solutions over endless slides. 8 years building Python systems that process millions of records daily for companies across Dubai, London, and San Francisco.</p>
                
                <p>Based in Dubai, serving UAE/GCC SMEs and US/UK startups. My focus is practical AI that reduces manual work, not theoretical models that sit on shelves.</p>
                
                <p>Core principle: Your data stays yours. I build systems that you own completely, with full source code transfer and no ongoing dependencies on external APIs unless explicitly requested.</p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <div class="faq-list">
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">What does "agentic AI" actually mean?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Agents that take action in your systems, not just provide advice. They log in, fetch data, make decisions based on rules you set, and update your systems automatically. Think robot employee, not smart chatbot.</div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">How do you price projects?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Fixed scope, fixed fee. We agree on exactly what gets built and what acceptance criteria look like. No hourly billing, no scope creep. You know the total cost upfront.</div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">What about data security and access?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Your data never leaves your systems unless required for processing. All agent actions are logged. Access is role-based with approval workflows. You can revoke access instantly at any time.</div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">How do you work with UAE companies while based in Dubai?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">I'm based in Dubai and meet clients locally. Invoicing is through our registered Pakistan entity to keep costs low. UAE business license available for enterprise clients who require it.</div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">What if the acceptance criteria aren't met?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">We fix it within the agreed sprint timeline at no extra cost. If we fundamentally can't deliver what was promised, you get a full refund. Binary success criteria prevent ambiguity.</div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">What are typical project timelines?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Simple automations: 14 days. Dashboards: 10 days. Custom AI models: 3-6 weeks. Complex integrations: 4-8 weeks. We give exact timelines after the discovery call.</div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">Do you only work with tech companies?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">No. We've automated workflows for logistics, retail, consulting, and manufacturing companies. If you have repetitive tasks involving data, we can probably automate them.</div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">What if our systems change after the project?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">You own all the code and documentation. Basic changes can be handled by your team. For major updates, we offer maintenance packages or one-off modifications.</div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">How do payments work?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">50% upfront to start, 50% on delivery and acceptance. For larger projects, we can split into 3 payments based on milestones. All payments secured through proper invoicing.</div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">Can you integrate with our existing software?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Most modern business software has APIs or export capabilities we can work with. CRM, accounting systems, email platforms, databases - if it has an API, we can connect to it.</div>
